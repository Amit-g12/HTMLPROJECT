        <strong>Johnny Depp and Amber Heard: A timeline of their relationship, allegations, and court battles</strong>
    </h1>
    <p>The trial in Johnny Depp's defamation lawsuit against Amber Heard is currently underway in Virginia.</p>
    <p>Depp sued Heard in March 2019, alleging a column Heard wrote in The Washington Post about domestic violence was defamatory and asking for $50m in damages. Heard has filed a $100m countersuit.</p>
    <p>The proceedings began with jury selection on 11 April 2022 in Fairfax, Virginia. Heard's witnesses are expected to include James Franco and Elon Musk.</p>
    <p>Here is a timeline of Johnny Depp and Amber Heard's relationship, separation, and court battles, from when they are said to have started dating to the latest trial:</p>
    <p>
        <strong>2012: Johnny Depp and Amber Heard start dating</strong>
    </p>
    <p>Johnny Depp and Amber Heard are believed to have started dating that year, after Depp split from his longtime partner, French actor Vanessa Paradis. Depp and Paradis have two children: a daughter named Lily-Rose and a son named Jack.</p>
    <p>Heard and Depp are believed to have met on the set of the 2011 film The Rum Diary, in which they both starred.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>March 2014: Johnny Depp and Amber Heard get engaged</strong>
    </p>
    <p>Johnny Depp confirms that he and Amber Heard are engaged, after a couple of months of speculation. “The fact that I'm wearing a chick's ring on my finger is probably a dead giveaway,” he says while promoting the film Transcendence. “Not very subtle.”</p>
    <p>
        <strong>February 2015: Johnny Depp and Amber Heard get married</strong>
    </p>
    <p>Amber Heard and Johnny Depp marry. According to People magazine, they had two ceremonies: the first at Depp's home in Los Angeles, and the second at Depp's private island in the Bahamas.</p>

    <p><strong>May 2016: Amber Heard files for divorce</strong></p>
    <p><i>Amber Heard files for divorce from Johnny Depp, citing irreconcilable differences. That same month, a judge grants Heard a restraining order against Depp over allegations of domestic violence on his part.</i></p>
    <p>In a sworn declaration, Heard alleges that Depp threw a cellphone at her during a fight, which struck her in the eye and the cheek, and that he screamed at her, hit her, violently grabbed her face, and pulled her hair. According to The Associated
        Press, she submits to the court a photo of her bruised face when requesting the restraining order.</p>
    <p>Heard is seen with “a bruise on her right cheek below the eye”, per the AP, during a court appearance.</p>
    <p>“During the entirety of our relationship, Johnny has been verbally and physically abusive to me,” Heard writes in the filing. “I endured excessive emotional, verbal and physical abuse from Johnny, which has included angry, hostile, humiliating and
        threatening assaults to me whenever I questioned his authority or disagreed with him.”</p>
    <p>She also writes: “I live in fear that Johnny will return to (our house) unannounced to terrorize me, physically and emotionally.”</p>
    <p>Depp has denied the allegations <span>domestic abuse.</span> His lawyers alleged in a court document in 2016 that Heard was “attempting to secure a premature financial resolution by alleging abuse”.</p>
    <p>The LAPD said in May 2016 that police officers who responded to a domestic incident radio call on the 21 of that month found “no evidence of any crime”. Heard's legal team has since subpoenaed the LAPD in connection to that same call as part of the
        ongoing defamation court case opposing Heard and Depp.</p>

        <strong>August 2016: Johnny Depp and Amber Heard settle their divorce</strong>
    </p>
    <p>After months of contentious proceedings, Depp and Heard reach a settlement in their divorce.</p>
    <p>“Our relationship was intensely passionate and at times volatile, but always bound by love,” the pair say in a joint statement at the time. “Neither party has made false accusations for financial gain. There was never any intent of physical or emotional
        harm.”
    </p>
    <p>Heard pledges to donate the $7m from Depp to the American Civil Liberties Union and the Children's Hospital Los Angeles. (In August 2021, a New York judge partially granted a petition from Depp to determine whether donations had been made.)</p>
    <p>
        <bold>January 2017: The divorce is official</bold>
    </p>
    <p>Depp and Heard formally finalize their divorce.</p>
    <p>“We are all pleased to put this unpleasant chapter in Mr Depp and his family's lives behind them,” Depp's attorney Laura Wasser writes in a statement. “Having his request for entry of the dissolution judgment granted today made it a particularly lucky
        Friday the 13th.”</p>

    <h2><mark>Russia warns West over risk of conflict with NATO</mark></h2>
    <img src="https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAXaNJ2.img?h=1080&w=1920&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f&x=511&y=369" alt="">
    <div class="bottom-left"><a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/russia-warns-west-over-risk-of-conflict-with-nato/ar-AAXaG7a?ocid=msedgntp&cvid=39450a1fa65b471bb9a0b34714979f29" target="_blank">MSN Home Page</a></div>
    <p>Former president Dmitry Medvedev, now deputy chairman of Russia's security council, said such a conflict with NATO always carried the risk of turning into a full blown nuclear war.</p>
    <p>Russia's Feb. 24 invasion of Ukraine has killed thousands of people, laid waste to swathes of its former Soviet neighbour and raised fears of the gravest confrontation between Russia and the United States since the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis.</p>
    <p>"NATO countries pumping weapons into Ukraine, training troops to use Western equipment, sending in mercenaries and the exercises of Alliance countries near our borders increase the likelihood of a direct and open conflict between NATO and Russia,"
        Medvedev said in a Telegram post.</p>
    <p>"Such a conflict always has the risk of turning into a full-fledged nuclear war," Medvedev said. "This will be a disastrous scenario for everyone."</p>
    <p>Russia and the United States are by far the world's biggest nuclear powers: Russia has some 6,257 nuclear warheads while NATO's three nuclear powers - the United States, United Kingdom and France - have about 6,065 warheads combined, according to
        the Washington-based Arms Control Association.</p>
    <p>Putin says the "special military operation" in Ukraine is necessary because the United States was using Ukraine to threaten Russia and Moscow had to defend against the persecution of Russian-speaking people.</p>
    <p>Putin, who says Ukraine and Russia are essentially one people, casts the war as an inevitable confrontation with the United States, which he accuses of threatening Russia by meddling in its backyard through NATO eastward enlargement.</p>
    <p>Ukraine says it is fighting an imperial-style land grab and that Putin's claims of genocide are nonsense. Kyiv says Putin's invasion has only strengthened the Ukrainian people's wish to turn westwards out of Russia's orbit.</p>

    <h3><mark>Middle school student asked to change clothes for violating dress code policy</mark></h3>
    <img src="https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAXaTqq.img?h=1080&w=1920&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f" alt=""><br>
    <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/lifestyle/lifestyle-buzz/middle-school-student-asked-to-change-clothes-for-violating-dress-code-policy/ar-AAXaLWK?ocid=msedgntp&cvid=899e67f7f3c74400b0c543c31a4efb8a" target="_blank">MSN Home Page</a>

    <p>Logan Gray, 12, who is in the 7th grade at <strong>Gateway Middle School in Maumee</strong>, recalls getting dressed for school Monday morning.</p>
    <p>“My mom bought me a new dress and it was really pretty, so I decided I was going to wear it to school the next day,” said Gray. “I was very excited and ready to show it off to all my friends.”</p>
    <p>Gray says she wore a short-sleeved collared dress, over white tights and with brown leather boots.</p>
    <p>“She looked very nice and it was kind of like a dress for church,” explained her mother, Francheska Gill.</p>
    <p>Thirty minutes into her first class, Gray says she was removed and asked to go to the office.</p>
    <p>“They said they had to measure it with a ruler and that it was above the dress code, even though it was only a half-inch over,” said Gray.</p>
    <p>Gill says she was notified by the school shortly after 8:30a.m. that her daughter had violated the dress code policy and was not allowed to return to class until she had a change of clothes.</p>
    <p>“Her dad had to drive up to the school and bring a different change of clothes,” Gill said. “I was extremely upset. I was just like, why? I called the school and wanted to know why she was dress coded? Why she had to change?”</p>
    <p>According to the Maumee City School District's dress policy dresses, skirts and shorts must be no more than four inches above the knee cap. Students are also not permitted to dress in a manner that would distract from or disrupt the education process.
        The policy adds that “determination of appropriateness lies solely at the discretion of the building administration or his/her designee.”</p>
    <p>“I don't think that's right. I don't think that's fair,” Gill said. “I think that is a terrible dress code rule or regulation.”</p>
    <p>Gill posted a photo of her daughter in the outfit she wore to school on Facebook. Many people had commented in support of her statement.</p>
    <p>When asked if the pre-teen's outfit seemed inappropriate for school, father Craig Paff responded by saying, “No, not at all. I'd let me daughter wear that.”</p>
    <p>“I don't see anything wrong with that,” said Amena Flanagan, who is a mom of three. “It just looks like she is finding her own style.”</p>
    <p>Gray says she feels she was unfairly targeted due to her body type.</p>
    <p>“It kind of made me feel really bad because there was a lot of other people who were wearing stuff above the dress code,” she said.</p>
    <p>“She even made the comment that she was going to work really hard this summer to lose a bunch of weight just so next year when she goes to school, she won't have these issues,” her mother said.</p>
    <p>Gill and Gray said they hope that this brings about changes to the dress code policy to make it more equal for all students, adding that they are open to the idea of uniforms.</p>
    <p>In response, Maumee City School District shared the following statement:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The Maumee City Schools board of education has approved a dress code policy that applies to students in kindergarten through 12th grade. Students are not sent home from school for dress code violations, rather they are provided with options:
            <ul>
                <li>change into something that is laundered and provided to them by the school and continue the school day or</li>
                <li>the office contacts a parent or family member who brings something to school so the student can change and continue the school day</li>
            </ul>
            <li>The dress code policy is included in all student handbooks and discussed with students by staff members throughout the school year. In addition, the dress code policy is reviewed every few years by a group of students, parents, and staff members.</li>

    <h4>Victims of Surfside Condo Collapse Reach $997 Million Settlement</h4>
    <img src="https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AAXa2Yo.img?h=1080&w=1920&m=6&q=60&o=f&l=f" alt=""><br>
    <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/realestate/victims-of-surfside-condo-collapse-reach-997-million-settlement/ar-AAXatzG?bncnt=BroadcastNews_BreakingNews&ocid=UCPNC2&cvid=416f942b2da549d9b1312c5c8ea07b9f" target="_blank">MSN Home Page</a>
    <p>The payout, announced in a court hearing Wednesday, would settle claims brought by family members of the 98 victims of the collapse of Champlain Towers South last June.</p>
    <p>Defendants in the case included the building's insurers, developers of a neighboring condo building, an engineering firm that warned of the tower's structural issues before its collapse and others.</p>
    <p>The settlement is much higher than most lawyers initially expected. The initial pool of insurance money to settle both claims for victims who lost their homes and those who lost family members was $50 million.</p>
    <p>Earlier this spring, condo plaintiffs settled their property-damage claims for about $83 million.</p>
    <p>The case was settled on an unusually tight timeline. Circuit Court Judge Michael Hanzman in Miami had said he wanted the litigation to be resolved within a year, an accelerated timeline for class-action lawsuits, which can take years to resolve. The
        judge said he wanted the insurance proceeds to go to the victims rather than be gobbled up in legal fees from protracted litigation.</p>
    <p>“It was as difficult a case as one gets,” Judge Hanzman said during Wednesday's hearing. “For results like this to happen a lot of things have to break your way.”</p>
    <p>The judge will have to approve the settlement for it to become final.</p>
    <p>The 40-year-old building with some 136 apartments collapsed in the early morning hours when many residents were asleep. It is a rare event for a building to collapse with no clear trigger, such as an earthquake, and it raised troubling questions about
        the country's aging condo buildings.</p>
    <p>Plaintiff attorneys had said it would take close to $1 billion to compensate all the victims fairly based on the value of the units lost, which ranged from about $400,000 to about $2.9 million, compensation for trauma and potential punitive damages
        a jury might award. But attorneys said they were unlikely to reach that number unless they could bring in a deep-pocketed defendant.</p>
    <p>As the linchpin of that effort, surviving residents and victims' families sued the developers of the neighboring luxury condo, Eighty Seven Park, in November, alleging that the nearby construction destabilized the building and helped lead to the collapse.</p>
    <p>Attorneys at the hearing didn't disclose the breakdown of how much individual defendants were paying as part of the settlement.</p>
    <p>Michael Thomas, an attorney for the development team behind Eighty Seven Park, said the building's development “in no way caused or contributed to the collapse of Champlain Towers South.”</p>
    <p>“Hopefully, ending this litigation will help bring some closure to the survivors of this tragic event,” he said.</p>
    <p>Separately, the land on which the collapsed condo building once stood is expected to be sold for somewhere upward of $100 million.</p>
